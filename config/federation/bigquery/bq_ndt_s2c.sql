-- bq_ndt_discards returns the number NDT S2C tests with a time window that
-- overlaps with a switch utilization time windows in which there were a
-- non-zero number of uplink discards measured. DISCO polls switch SNMP data
-- every 10s. For every 10s SNMP data polling interval, if discards were
-- observed, then this query looks for all NDT S2C test with a start or end
-- time equivalent to the start or end time of the SNMP polling interval, or an
-- NDT S2C start or end time that falls within the SNMP polling interval.
-- For faster queries we use `partition_date` boundaries. And, to
-- guarantee the partition_date data is "complete" (all data collected
-- and parsed) we should wait 36 hours after start of a given day.
-- The following is equivalent to the pseudo code:
--     date(now() - 12h) - 1d
DECLARE query_date DATE DEFAULT DATE(TIMESTAMP_SUB(TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 12 HOUR), DAY), INTERVAL 24 HOUR));

-- Takes ParseInfo.TaskFileName and returns an M-Lab hostname.
