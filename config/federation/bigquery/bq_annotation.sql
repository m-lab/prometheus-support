-- bq_annotation calculates the number of successfully annotated tests per day.
--
-- This query exports three values:
--   bq_annotation_geo_success -- number of successfully geo annotated tests.
--   bq_annotation_asn_success -- number of successfully asn annotated tests.
--   bq_annotation_total -- total number of tests checked for annotations.
--
-- Each value above also has a "datatype" label.
--
-- TODO(https://github.com/m-lab/dev-tracker/issues/510): once gardener supports
-- "daily" processing, update queries to look at the last 24hrs.
--
-- TODO(https://github.com/m-lab/dev-tracker/issues/496): once parsers write
-- directly to canonical tables for k8s platform data, enumerate all supported
-- datatypes.
