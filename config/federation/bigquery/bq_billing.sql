-- bq_billing_hourly calculates the hourly GCP billing costs and credits from
-- two days prior. Because GCP billing information is exported to BigQuery
-- periodically, it may take up to 1.6 days after a given billing hour before
-- all billing information is available in BigQuery. To keep the offset simple,
-- we round up to 2days.
--
-- This query exports two values:
--   bq_billing_hourly_costs - total real costs.
--   bq_billing_hourly_credits - total credits that offset costs, this includes
--     the sum of billing credits and "sustained usage" discounts.
--
-- Each metric above has multiple labels that allow aggregation across various
-- dimensions.
