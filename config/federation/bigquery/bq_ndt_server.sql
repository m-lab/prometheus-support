-- bq_ndt_metrics calculates the daily median rtt as well as avg and median
-- upload and download rates per machine. These values can help recognize major
-- performance regressions of servers or kernels.
--
-- Note: this query returns multiple values. So, resulting metrics will be:
--   bq_ndt_server_tests
--   bq_ndt_server_download_avg_rate
--   bq_ndt_server_download_median_rate
--   bq_ndt_server_download_median_rtt
--   bq_ndt_server_upload_avg_rate
--   bq_ndt_server_upload_median_rate
--   bq_ndt_server_upload_median_rtt
