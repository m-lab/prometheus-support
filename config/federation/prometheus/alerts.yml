# See https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules
# for more information on the alerting rules syntax.
#
## Notes about delay.
#
# There are inherent delays in the monitoring and alert pipeline. When
# designing alerts, remember that each step includes some delay:
#
#  * the time between reality changing and monitoring observing the change.
#  * the time between the observed change and the delay defined by the alert.
#  * the time between a firing alert and the "group_wait" time in alertmanager.
#  * the time between sending a notification and the notification arriving.
#
# For example, for a 60s collection period, a 2m alert delay, a 30s group_wait,
# and a 15s-3m SMS delivery delay, the time between reality changing and a
# human knowing could be over six minutes.
#
# Your job is to balance false-positives with responsiveness when necessary.

# accessible again.

# TODO:
#   Replace this with two other alerts:
#    1.  Alert if hourly test volume on servers drops relative to same hour on recent days.
#    2.  E2E alert that compares rows in tables to test volume on servers.
#
# ParserDailyVolumeTooLow: 24 hour test volume has dropped over 30% compared to
# the average of the 2 smallest test volumes of 4 days out of the last week.  Two vectors
# of conservative constant value avoid false alarms when there is little valid history.
# On occasion, processing may fall behind a bit.  The "FOR 2h" waits 2h before triggering
# an actual alert, so the pipeline may fall behind for up to 2 hours without alerting.
# However, if the pipeline falls several hours behind, and stays behind for more than
# 2 hours, the alert will fire.
#
# In normal operation, we expect the 50th quantile to split mid-way between the two smallest
# volume days of the 4 sample days.  The 4 sample always include one weekend day, so one of
# the two smallest days will generally be a weekend day.
# For example, for a Tuesday, the prior data might be ordered (decreasing):
# M, F, W, Sa, C1, C2,
# and the 50th quantile will be midway between previous Sat and previous Wed.
#
# The alert condition ignores batch processing.
#
# Implementation notes:
# This alert uses label_replace to merge multiple vectors.  We tried simpler queries using
# AND, OR or +, but these do not do what we need.  We use label_replace to add a new "delay"
# label, which then allows us to compute quantile across multiple vectors.  (Or we could compute
# sums, averages, topk, min, etc.)
# The constant vectors require adding two labels, "service" which associates with a pipeline, and
# "delay" which differentiates from the actual delayed metrics for 1d, 3d, etc.
# For each pipeline service, the quantile computation then aggregates across the 6 vectors in
# the delay dimension.
