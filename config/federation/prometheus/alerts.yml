#
## Notes about delay.
#
# There are inherent delays in the monitoring and alert pipeline. When
# designing alerts, remember that each step includes some delay:
#
#  * the time between reality changing and monitoring observing the change.
#  * the time between the observed change and the delay defined by the alert.
#  * the time between a firing alert and the "group_wait" time in alertmanager.
#  * the time between sending a notification and the notification arriving.
#
# For example, for a 60s collection period, a 2m alert delay, a 30s group_wait,
# and a 15s-3m SMS delivery delay, the time between reality changing and a
# human knowing could be over six minutes.
#
# Your job is to balance false-positives with responsiveness when necessary.

# TODO:
#   Replace this with two other alerts:
#    1.  Alert if hourly test volume on servers drops relative to same hour on recent days.
#    2.  E2E alert that compares rows in tables to test volume on servers.
#
# ParserDailyVolumeTooLow: 24 hour test volume has dropped over 30% compared to
# the average of the 2 smallest test volumes of 4 days out of the last week.  Two vectors
# of conservative constant value avoid false alarms when there is little valid history.
# On occasion, processing may fall behind a bit.  The "FOR 2h" waits 2h before triggering
# an actual alert, so the pipeline may fall behind for up to 2 hours without alerting.
# However, if the pipeline falls several hours behind, and stays behind for more than
# 2 hours, the alert will fire.
#
# In normal operation, we expect the 50th quantile to split mid-way between the two smallest
# volume days of the 4 sample days.  The 4 sample always include one weekend day, so one of
# the two smallest days will generally be a weekend day.
# For example, for a Tuesday, the prior data might be ordered (decreasing):
# M, F, W, Sa, C1, C2,
# and the 50th quantile will be midway between previous Sat and previous Wed.
#
# The alert condition ignores batch processing.
#
# Implementation notes:
# This alert uses label_replace to merge multiple vectors.  We tried simpler queries using
# AND, OR or +, but these do not do what we need.  We use label_replace to add a new "delay"
# label, which then allows us to compute quantile across multiple vectors.  (Or we could compute
# sums, averages, topk, min, etc.)
# The constant vectors require adding two labels, "service" which associates with a pipeline, and
# "delay" which differentiates from the actual delayed metrics for 1d, 3d, etc.
# For each pipeline service, the quantile computation then aggregates across the 6 vectors in
# the delay dimension.

      description: etcd cluster members are changing leaders too frequently.
        Leader changes are normal (e.g., a master node is rebooted), but they
        should not happen too often. Look into networking, resource or other
        issues on the master nodes.

        in the etcd cluster. These type of errors are normally related to two
        issues - temporary failures related to a leader election or longer
        downtime caused by a loss of quorum in the cluster.
