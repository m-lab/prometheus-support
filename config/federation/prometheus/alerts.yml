#
## Notes about delay.
#
# There are inherent delays in the monitoring and alert pipeline. When
# designing alerts, remember that each step includes some delay:
#
#  * the time between reality changing and monitoring observing the change.
#  * the time between the observed change and the delay defined by the alert.
#  * the time between a firing alert and the "group_wait" time in alertmanager.
#  * the time between sending a notification and the notification arriving.
#
# For example, for a 60s collection period, a 2m alert delay, a 30s group_wait,
# and a 15s-3m SMS delivery delay, the time between reality changing and a
# human knowing could be over six minutes.
#
# Your job is to balance false-positives with responsiveness when necessary.

        Blackbox exporter probes (for ndt_ssl) are succeeding to a node that

        then at some point the machine has its network connectivity restored.
        In this situation all of the containers on the machine are still
        running, but the node is no longer known to kubernetes. It becomes like
        a zombie node, possibly continuing to upload data to GCS and serve
        experiment tests. The simple fix is to reboot the zombie node.

# TODO:
#   Replace this with two other alerts:
#    1.  Alert if hourly test volume on servers drops relative to same hour on recent days.
#    2.  E2E alert that compares rows in tables to test volume on servers.
#
# ParserDailyVolumeTooLow: 24 hour test volume has dropped over 30% compared to
# the average of the 2 smallest test volumes of 4 days out of the last week.  Two vectors
# of conservative constant value avoid false alarms when there is little valid history.
# On occasion, processing may fall behind a bit.  The "FOR 2h" waits 2h before triggering
# an actual alert, so the pipeline may fall behind for up to 2 hours without alerting.
# However, if the pipeline falls several hours behind, and stays behind for more than
# 2 hours, the alert will fire.
#
# In normal operation, we expect the 50th quantile to split mid-way between the two smallest
# volume days of the 4 sample days.  The 4 sample always include one weekend day, so one of
# the two smallest days will generally be a weekend day.
# For example, for a Tuesday, the prior data might be ordered (decreasing):
# M, F, W, Sa, C1, C2,
# and the 50th quantile will be midway between previous Sat and previous Wed.
#
# The alert condition ignores batch processing.
#
# Implementation notes:
# This alert uses label_replace to merge multiple vectors.  We tried simpler queries using
# AND, OR or +, but these do not do what we need.  We use label_replace to add a new "delay"
# label, which then allows us to compute quantile across multiple vectors.  (Or we could compute
# sums, averages, topk, min, etc.)
# The constant vectors require adding two labels, "service" which associates with a pipeline, and
# "delay" which differentiates from the actual delayed metrics for 1d, 3d, etc.
# For each pipeline service, the quantile computation then aggregates across the 6 vectors in
# the delay dimension.

        necessary delete them from the cluster so the rolling reboot can
        continue. Looks at the log of the update-operator pod in the
        reboot-coordinator namespace to see which node it may be stuck on.
